# Single-Page-CV

A simple project to practice building web pages with HTML while mastering the Git and GitHub workflow.

## 🚀 Project Purpose & Goal

The primary goal of this repository is not just to build an HTML site, but to serve as a learning ground for professional Git branching and version control.

### My Git Workflow
This project strictly follows a `dev` -> `main` branching model:

* **`main` branch:** This is the production-ready branch. It only contains stable, finished code that has been reviewed and merged.
* **`dev` branch:** This is the primary development branch. All new work, features, and fixes are created here. Code is only merged into `main` from this branch via a Pull Request.

## 💻 Technologies Used
* HTML5
* CSS
* Git & GitHub

## Key Features
* A semantic HTML structure for a personal portfolio
